# Autoencoder
 
Implementation of a Convolutional Autoencoder for univariate Time Series.

## Requirements

You need Python 3.8 to run the code. There are some packages that for the moment are not compatible with version 3.9. See [here](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/issues/11287).

## Get Started

Once with a compatible version:

- Create a virtual environment

```
python3 -m venv .venv
```

- Activate the environment

on Linux,

```
source /path/to/Autoencoder/.venv/bin/activate
```

on Windows,

```
/path/to/Autoencoder/.venv/Scripts/activate.bat
```

- Install the dependencies

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Now the code is ready to be executed.
